a[name='earn']
h3 Get started: Earn Credits

p Earn money by working on issues, correctly solving these issues, and
  submitting the correct solutions by the issue maturation date and time.  After
  you resolved an issue, the research team will review your answer and make sure
  the answer is correct.  Issues with correct answers will be closed.  For every
  closed issue, that you have a contract for, you will earn the reward.  This
  means, you have to answer issues with enough time for the research team to
  review your answer before the contract matures and expires.  You can see the
  total credits awarded at the top right, next to your username and on your user
  profile in Bugmark.
