Open source software forms much of our digital infrastructure and has enabled the 
boom in non-differentiating software project teams. Peer production, the mechanism 
behind the development of open source software is an organizational innovation 
where developers, in a diverse and distributed community, self-match to the 
tasks best suited to them. Peer production has tackled complex projects, 
underlying billions of dollars in software production. A recent study, however, 
points out that this digital infrastructure is increasingly under strain (Eghbal, 2016).
